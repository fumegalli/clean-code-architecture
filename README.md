# Clean Code and Clean Architecture
Repository dedicated to my notes of Clean Code and Clean Architecture course by Rodrigo Branas

### [Refactoring](class-07/refactoring/README.md)
### [Testing](class-07/testing/README.md)
### [Ports & Adapters](class-07/ports-adapters/README.md)
### [Clean Architecture](class-07/clean-architecture/README.md)

My Feedback:
- Classes are too long
- Challenges could have acceptance criteria (expected request/response, scope, etc) to be more clear
